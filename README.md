# Health - AI Application
Health - AI uses probabilistic models to understand the variation of health metrics and inform patients about their health. The application uses dynamic visualisations and probabilistic multinomial regression to model historical datasets and then identify anomalies. It also makes intelligent suggestions to the patients and notifies users of abnormalities based on historical data and predictive values.
